I visited the hospital on April 5th for an emergency and was told my insurance was inactive.
This is shocking because I’ve been paying my premiums on time every month.
Now I’m being billed $2,300 out of pocket. I need this resolved ASAP — please confirm my coverage status and correct the hospital records.

# Claim Denial

My claim for a knee MRI done on March 20th was denied stating it wasn't medically necessary.
However, it was prescribed by my orthopedic specialist. I need a detailed explanation for the denial and how I can appeal this decision.

# Billing Error
ticket4 = """
I was charged twice for the same doctor visit on February 10th. The bill shows two identical charges, but I only had one appointment.
Please correct this billing error and refund the duplicate charge immediately.

# Coverage Inquiry

I'm planning to have a minor outpatient surgery next month and need to confirm if it's covered under my current plan.

# Dependent Coverage Issue
ticket6 = """
I added my newborn to my policy in January, but the pediatrician’s office says there’s no record of coverage.
