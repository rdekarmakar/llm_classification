1,"Customer1 : I visited the hospital on April 5th for an emergency and was told my insurance was inactive.
This is shocking because I’ve been paying my premiums on time every month.
Now I’m being billed $2,300 out of pocket. I need this resolved ASAP — please confirm my coverage status and correct the hospital records."
2,"Customer2: My claim for a knee MRI done on March 20th was denied stating it wasn't medically necessary.
However, it was prescribed by my orthopedic specialist. I need a detailed explanation for the denial and how I can appeal this decision."
3,"Customer3 : I was charged twice for the same doctor visit on February 10th. The bill shows two identical charges, but I only had one appointment.
Please correct this billing error and refund the duplicate charge immediately."
4,"Customer4:I'm planning to have a minor outpatient surgery next month and need to confirm if it's covered under my current plan.
Can you please send me details of what's included in my benefits and any pre-authorization requirements?"
5,"Customer5: I added my newborn to my policy in January, but the pediatrician’s office says there’s no record of coverage.
I’ve submitted the documents twice already. Can someone please verify the status and ensure my child is covered?"
6,"Customer6 : Hi Team,

I wanted to check if I'm eligible for the free annual health check-up mentioned in the policy.

Could you please let me know how to book it and if there’s a specific hospital or clinic I need to visit?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Best,
John Doe"
6,"Customer6: Hi Team,
I have not received any response to my previous email regarding the free annual health check-up mentioned in the policy.
I am really pissed off with the lack of communication from your side.
Can someone please get back to me with the details asap.

Thanks,
John Doe"
