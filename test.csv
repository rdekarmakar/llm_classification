I am extremely disappointed with the lack of response regarding my repeated queries about the cashless hospitalization process for my upcoming procedure under policy HI-123456789.

This level of delay and unresponsiveness is unacceptable, especially from a health insurance provider where timely support is critical. I expect an immediate and clear response.

Dear SafeCare Support Team,

I am writing to express my strong dissatisfaction regarding the denial of a recent claim for my spouse, Sarah Johnson, under policy number FFHI-456789123. The claim was related to hospitalization, and I fail to understand the reason for rejection as all required documents were submitted correctly and the treatment clearly falls under the covered benefits.

This denial is causing significant inconvenience and financial strain. I request a detailed explanation for the rejection along with an immediate review of the claim. Please provide guidance on any additional information or steps needed to resolve this issue promptly.

I expect swift action on this matter.

Regards,
Bob Johnson
